# Chapter 8: Error Handling, Recovery, and Adaptive Strategies

> "The true measure of an agentic system is not how well it performs when everything goes right, but how gracefully it recovers when things go wrong."

## Chapter Overview
This chapter explores comprehensive approaches to error handling, recovery mechanisms, and adaptive strategies in unified agentic systems. We examine how robust systems detect, diagnose, and recover from failures while maintaining user trust and operational continuity.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the taxonomy of errors in agentic systems
- Learn strategies for graceful failure and recovery
- Explore adaptive replanning techniques when operations fail
- Discover effective debugging and logging approaches
- Examine patterns for maintaining system resilience

## 8.1 Error Taxonomy and Classification

### Conceptual Framework
- Categories of errors in agentic systems (input errors, execution errors, context errors, resource errors)
- Deterministic vs. non-deterministic failures
- Severity classification and prioritization

### Technical Implementation
```json
{
  "error_taxonomy": {
    "input_errors": {
      "ambiguous_intent": {
        "description": "User request contains multiple possible interpretations",
        "severity": "low",
        "recovery": "clarification_dialog"
      },
      "incomplete_information": {
        "description": "Request lacks necessary parameters or context",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recovery": "parameter_extraction"
      },
      "unsupported_operation": {
        "description": "Request asks for functionality not supported by the system",
        "severity": "high",
        "recovery": "alternative_suggestion"
      }
    },
    "execution_errors": {
      // Additional error categories and details
    }
  }
}
```

## 8.2 Error Detection and Diagnostic Strategies

### Early Warning Systems
- Input validation techniques
- Precondition verification
- Anomaly detection in execution patterns
- Resource monitoring

### Diagnostic Approaches
- Root cause analysis methodologies
- Tracing through execution pipelines
- Context inspection and validation
- Environmental state assessment

### Implementation Example
```python
def validate_refactoring_request(request):
    """Validates a refactoring request and detects potential issues."""
    diagnostics = {
        "issues": [],
        "warnings": [],
        "validation_status": "passed"
    }
    
    # Check if target exists
    if not file_system.exists(request.target_path):
        diagnostics["issues"].append({
            "type": "missing_resource",
            "description": f"Target path {request.target_path} does not exist",
            "severity": "high"
        })
        diagnostics["validation_status"] = "failed"
    
    # Check permission
    if not file_system.has_write_permission(request.target_path):
        diagnostics["issues"].append({
            "type": "permission_error",
            "description": f"No write permission for {request.target_path}",
            "severity": "high"
        })
        diagnostics["validation_status"] = "failed"
    
    # Warn about potential conflicts
    if version_control.has_uncommitted_changes(request.target_path):
        diagnostics["warnings"].append({
            "type": "uncommitted_changes",
            "description": "Target has uncommitted changes in version control",
            "severity": "medium"
        })
    
    return diagnostics
```

## 8.3 Graceful Failure and User Communication

### Error Message Design
- Clarity and actionability principles
- Technical vs. user-friendly messaging
- Contextual guidance and next steps

### Communication Strategies
- Progressive disclosure of error details
- Visual indicators and status updates
- Managing user expectations and trust

### Error Response Example
```json
{
  "error_response": {
    "user_message": "I couldn't complete the refactoring because the Customer class has uncommitted changes.",
    "recommended_actions": [
      {
        "description": "Commit or stash your changes before refactoring",
        "action_type": "user_action",
        "command_suggestion": "git commit -m 'Save changes before refactoring'"
      },
      {
        "description": "Proceed anyway (not recommended)",
        "action_type": "override",
        "confirmation_required": true
      }
    ],
    "technical_details": {
      "error_type": "vcs_conflict",
      "affected_files": ["src/models/Customer.java", "src/services/CustomerService.java"],
      "error_code": "VCS-103"
    },
    "documentation_link": "https://docs.example.com/errors/vcs-conflicts"
  }
}
```

class ResilienceWrapper<T> {
  private readonly operation: () => Promise<T>;
  private readonly fallbackOperation?: () => Promise<T>;
  private readonly maxRetries: number;
  private readonly retryDelay: number;
  
  constructor(options: {
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    fallback?: () => Promise<T>,
    maxRetries?: number,
    retryDelay?: number
  }) {
    this.operation = options.operation;
    this.fallbackOperation = options.fallback;
    this.maxRetries = options.maxRetries || 3;
    this.retryDelay = options.retryDelay || 1000;
  }
  
  async execute(): Promise<T> {
    let lastError: Error | undefined;
    
    // Try main operation with retries
    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < this.maxRetries; attempt++) {
      try {
        return await this.operation();
      } catch (error) {
        lastError = error as Error;
        console.log(`Attempt ${attempt + 1} failed: ${error.message}`);
        
        if (attempt < this.maxRetries - 1) {
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.retryDelay));
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Try fallback if available
    if (this.fallbackOperation) {
      try {
        console.log("Executing fallback operation");
        return await this.fallbackOperation();
      } catch (fallbackError) {
        console.error("Fallback operation failed:", fallbackError);
        throw new Error(`Main operation and fallback both failed. Original error: ${lastError?.message}`);
      }
    }
    
    throw lastError;
  }
}
```

    },
    "adapted_plan": {
      "new_goal": "Generate migration script for database changes",
      "rationale": "User cannot directly modify the database schema, but can create a migration script for later execution by admin",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "step-001",
          "tool": "schema_analyzer",
          "parameters": {
            "target_class": "Customer",
            "proposed_changes": "support_multiple_addresses"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "step-002",
          "tool": "migration_generator",
          "parameters": {
            "schema_changes": "$output.step-001",
            "format": "SQL",
            "target_database": "postgresql"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "user_guidance": "I couldn't modify the database directly due to permission restrictions. Instead, I've created a migration script that you can provide to your database administrator."
  }
}
```

        self.context.update(kwargs)
    
    def clear_context(self, *keys):
        """Removes specified keys from context, or all if none specified."""
        if not keys:
            self.context = {}
        else:
            for key in keys:
                if key in self.context:
                    del self.context[key]
    
    def _create_log_entry(self, level, message, **kwargs):
        entry = {

            "level": level,
            "system": self.system_name,
            "instance": self.instance_id,
            "message": message,

        }
        
        # Add any additional information
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            if key != "context":  # Avoid overwriting the merged context
                entry[key] = value
        
        # Merge additional context if provided
        if "context" in kwargs:
            entry["context"].update(kwargs["context"])
            
        return entry
    
    def info(self, message, **kwargs):
        entry = self._create_log_entry("INFO", message, **kwargs)
        print(json.dumps(entry))
        return entry
    
    def error(self, message, exception=None, **kwargs):
        extra = kwargs.copy()
        if exception:
            extra["exception"] = {
                "type": type(exception).__name__,
                "message": str(exception),
                "traceback": traceback.format_exc()
            }
        
        entry = self._create_log_entry("ERROR", message, **extra)
        print(json.dumps(entry))
        return entry
    
    def warning(self, message, **kwargs):
        entry = self._create_log_entry("WARNING", message, **kwargs)
        print(json.dumps(entry))
        return entry
```

## Summary

This chapter has explored the critical domain of error handling, recovery, and adaptation in unified agentic systems. We've examined how to classify and diagnose errors, communicate effectively with users when things go wrong, implement robust recovery strategies, and adapt when original plans fail. 

The structured logging and monitoring approaches we've discussed provide the foundation for continuous improvement of error handling, turning system failures into opportunities for enhancement. As we've seen through various examples and case studies, effective error handling is not merely about preventing system crashes but about maintaining user trust and productivity even in the face of unexpected challenges.

As we move forward to Chapter 9, we'll explore performance optimization and scaling strategies, building on our understanding of resilient system design to create not only robust but also highly performant agentic systems.
