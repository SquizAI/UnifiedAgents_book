# Chapter 9: Performance Optimization and Scaling Strategies

## 9.1 Strategies for Token Usage Minimization and Latency Reduction

Efficient resource utilization is critical for responsive and cost-effective agentic systems:

* **Context Window Optimization**:
    * Implements sophisticated compression techniques that preserve semantic information while reducing token count, including selective summarization and context prioritization.
    * Employs advanced context windowing algorithms that intelligently rotate information based on relevance and recency, keeping the most valuable content within constrained token limits.

* **Predictive Request Modeling**:
    * Utilizes prediction models to anticipate likely user interactions and preload relevant context, dramatically reducing perceived latency.
    * Implements speculative execution of high-probability next steps, allowing instant response when predictions are accurate.

**Token Optimization Example**:
```json
{
  "context_optimization": {
    "original_context_size": 8750,
    "optimized_context_size": 3200,
