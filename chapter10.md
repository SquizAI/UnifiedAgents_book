# Chapter 10: Building a Full Agentic Framework from Scratch

## 10.1 Comprehensive Toolset Definition: JSON Schemas and Specifications

A robust toolset definition forms the foundation of a powerful agentic system:

* **Standardized Tool Schema Framework**:
    * Establishes a comprehensive schema system for defining tools, ensuring consistency, predictability, and thorough validation.
    * Implements structured metadata conventions that enhance discoverability, usability, and integration capabilities.

* **Parameter Schema Sophistication**:
    * Develops granular parameter specifications that capture complex constraints, relationships, and validation requirements.
    * Implements advanced type definitions that support complex data structures while maintaining strict validation guardrails.

**Tool Definition Example**:
```json
{
  "tool_schema": {
    "name": "code_refactor",
    "display_name": "Code Refactoring Tool",
    "description": "Performs intelligent code refactoring operations across multiple files with semantic understanding of code structure and dependencies.",

## 10.2 Deep Integration with LLMs and Advanced Prompt Architectures

Effective LLM integration requires sophisticated prompt engineering and thoughtful architecture:

* **Context-Aware Prompt Templates**:
    * Designs modular, parameterized prompt templates optimized for specific agent tasks and responsibilities.
    * Implements dynamic prompt construction that adapts to query complexity, tool requirements, and available context.

* **Orchestration Layer Design**:
    * Develops an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple LLM interactions for complex tasks.
    * Implements strategic decomposition of tasks into sub-problems optimally suited for LLM processing capabilities.

    * Implements transaction-like semantics for multi-step operations, ensuring system integrity during partial failures.

* **Secure Resource Interface Design**:
    * Establishes principled abstraction layers for interacting with system resources, enhancing security and portability.
    * Implements fine-grained permission models and sandboxing techniques to prevent unintended system modifications.
