# Glossary of Terms

This document provides standardized definitions for key terms used throughout "Unified Agentic Systems: The Ultimate Guide to AI-Driven Tool Integration." Maintaining consistent terminology across all chapters ensures clarity and precision in technical discussions.

## A

### Agentic System
An AI-powered computational system capable of observing its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specified goals or respond to user requests. In the context of this book, primarily refers to systems designed to assist with software development tasks.

### Agent-Environment Interaction
The bidirectional communication pattern between an AI agent and its operating environment, including file systems, IDEs, and other computational resources.

### Adaptability
The capability of an agentic system to modify its behavior based on changing contexts, user feedback, or environmental conditions.

## C

### Context Model
The internal representation that an agentic system maintains about the user's current task, environment state, and relevant history.

### Context Preservation
Techniques for maintaining important information across multiple interactions or tool invocations.

### Core Interaction Layer
The architectural component responsible for processing user inputs, maintaining context, and coordinating responses.

## D

### Decision Tree
A structured approach to making sequential decisions based on available information, used particularly in tool selection and execution planning.

### Dispatch System
The component responsible for routing requests to appropriate tools based on intent analysis and context.

## E

### Embodied Cognition
The concept that intelligence emerges from an entity's interactions with its environment, applied to agentic systems through their ability to interact with computational environments.

### Execution Pipeline
The sequential process through which user requests are parsed, interpreted, planned, executed, and responded to.

## I

### Intent Parsing
The process of analyzing user input to determine the underlying goal or request.

### IDE Integration
Methods for embedding agentic systems within Integrated Development Environments to enhance developer productivity.

## J

### JSON Schema
A vocabulary that allows for the annotation and validation of JSON documents, used extensively in tool definitions and communication protocols.

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A neural network-based AI system trained on vast text corpora, capable of understanding and generating human language, and serving as the foundation for many agentic systems.

### Long-Term Memory
Persistent storage mechanisms that allow agentic systems to recall information across sessions or extended interactions.

## O

### Orchestration
The coordination of multiple tools, operations, or services to accomplish complex tasks.

## S

### Semantic Retrieval
The process of recalling information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

### System Resource Interface
The architectural component that provides standardized access to system resources like file systems, network services, and application states.

## T

### Tool Management System
The component responsible for registering, validating, and executing tools within an agentic framework.

### Tool Validation
The process of verifying that inputs to tools conform to expected schemas and that outputs meet quality requirements.

## U

### Unified Architecture
An approach to designing agentic systems where all components share a common context model and operate within a cohesive framework.
