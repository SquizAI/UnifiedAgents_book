o# Code Example Style Guide

This document provides guidelines for creating consistent, high-quality code examples throughout "Unified Agentic Systems: The Ultimate Guide to AI-Driven Tool Integration."

## Purpose

Code examples in the book serve to:
1. Illustrate theoretical concepts with practical implementations
2. Provide working reference implementations readers can adapt
3. Demonstrate best practices in modern software development
4. Create a cohesive narrative across different chapters

## General Principles

### 1. Readability Over Cleverness

Code should prioritize clarity and understandability over brevity or cleverness. Examples should be approachable to readers with intermediate programming experience.

### 2. Consistency Across Languages

When showing implementations in multiple programming languages, maintain consistent patterns, variable names, and structure to highlight the similarities and differences between language implementations.

### 3. Self-Contained Examples

Each example should be as self-contained as possible while remaining concise. Include necessary imports and context but avoid unnecessary complexity.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Start with simple implementations and gradually introduce complexity. Initial examples should focus on core concepts before advanced optimizations or edge cases.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints consistently (Python 3.6+ style)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Prefer explicit over implicit approaches
- Target Python 3.8+ compatibility

```python
# Good example
def process_tool_response(response: Dict[str, Any], max_retries: int = 3) -> Result:
    """
    Process the response from a tool execution with retry logic.
    
    Args:
        response: The raw response from the tool
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts
        
    Returns:
        Processed result object
        
    Raises:
        ToolExecutionError: If processing fails after all retries
    """
    retry_count = 0
    
    while retry_count < max_retries:
        try:
            return Result(
                status=response["status"],
                data=response["data"],
                metadata=response.get("metadata", {})
            )
        except KeyError as e:
            logger.warning(f"Missing key in response: {e}, attempt {retry_count + 1}/{max_retries}")
            retry_count += 1
            
    raise ToolExecutionError(f"Failed to process response after {max_retries} attempts")
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Include TypeScript type definitions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Include JSDoc comments
- Follow Airbnb style guide conventions
- Use modern async/await patterns over callbacks

```typescript
/**
 * Processes the response from a tool execution with retry logic
 * @param response - The raw response from the tool
 * @param maxRetries - Maximum number of retry attempts
 * @returns Processed result object
 * @throws {ToolExecutionError} If processing fails after all retries
 */
async function processToolResponse(
  response: ToolResponse, 
  maxRetries: number = 3
): Promise<Result> {
  let retryCount = 0;
  
  while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      return new Result({
        status: response.status,
        data: response.data,
        metadata: response.metadata || {}
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn(`Error processing response: ${error.message}, attempt ${retryCount + 1}/${maxRetries}`);
      retryCount++;
    }
  }
  
  throw new ToolExecutionError(`Failed to process response after ${maxRetries} attempts`);
}
```

## Structure and Format

### 1. Header Comment

All code examples should begin with a header comment that includes:
- Purpose of the code
- Where it fits in the agentic system architecture
- Any prerequisites or dependencies

### 2. Consistent Sectioning

Organize longer examples with clear section comments:

```python
# ==========================================
# 1. Configuration and Setup
# ==========================================

# ... configuration code here ...

# ==========================================
# 2. Core Implementation
# ==========================================

# ... main implementation code here ...

# ==========================================
# 3. Usage Example
# ==========================================

# ... example usage code here ...
```

### 3. Error Handling

Include appropriate error handling in all examples:
- Use try/catch (or equivalent) blocks for critical operations
- Show both the "happy path" and error paths
- Include logging at appropriate levels
- Demonstrate proper error propagation

### 4. Comments and Documentation

- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Include references to related sections of the book
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Explain performance considerations when relevant

### 5. Example Usage

End substantial code examples with a demonstration of how to use the implementation:

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setup example
    registry = ToolRegistry()
    registry.register_tool(...)
    
    # Demonstrate key functionality
    result = registry.find_tool("code_search")
    print(f"Found tool: {result.name}")
    
    # Show expected output in comments
    # Expected output:
    # Found tool: code_search
```

## Best Practices for JSON Examples

### 1. Consistent Formatting

- Use 2-space indentation
- Include commas after all items in arrays and objects (except the last)
- Use double quotes for property names and string values

### 2. Example Schema

When showing JSON schemas:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name", "parameters"],
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the tool to execute"
    },
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Parameters to pass to the tool"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Example Values

When showing example JSON data:

```json
{
  "name": "code_search",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "function calculateDistance",
    "file_types": [".js", ".ts"],
    "max_results": 5
  }
}
```

## Language Selection Guidelines

Choose the appropriate language based on the context:

1. **Python** for:
   - Core concepts and general examples
   - Data processing and machine learning components
   - Server-side logic

2. **JavaScript/TypeScript** for:
   - UI components and client-side integration
   - Web-based tool implementations
   - Modern IDE extensions

3. **JSON** for:
   - Tool schemas
   - Configuration files
   - Data exchange formats
   - API contracts

4. **Pseudocode** for:
   - Language-agnostic algorithmic concepts
   - High-level architectural descriptions
   - When implementation details are less important than the concept

## Code Example Testing

All code examples in the book should be:
1. Syntax checked in the target language
2. Executable in isolation (when appropriate)
3. Checked for edge cases and error conditions
4. Reviewed for security best practices

## Naming Conventions

Use a consistent naming pattern across all examples:

| Item Type | Convention | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Classes | PascalCase | `ToolRegistry`, `ResponseHandler` |
| Functions/Methods | camelCase (JS), snake_case (Python) | `processToolResponse`, `process_tool_response` |
| Variables | camelCase (JS), snake_case (Python) | `toolResult`, `tool_result` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `ToolResponse`, `ExecutionResult` |
| File names | kebab-case | `tool-registry.ts`, `tool_registry.py` |

## Visual Presentation

When displaying code in the book:

1. Use syntax highlighting appropriate to the language
2. Break long lines sensibly (80-100 characters)
3. Use consistent font and formatting
4. Add line numbers for referenced code
5. Highlight key portions when discussing specific features

## Example Integrations

When showing how multiple components interact:

1. Include sequence diagrams alongside code when helpful
2. Show clear separation between components
3. Demonstrate typical information flow
4. Include error handling at integration points

## Language-Specific Notes

For language-specific implementation details that might be unfamiliar to readers from other language backgrounds, include brief explanatory notes:

```python
# Note: Python's context managers (with statements) automatically handle resource cleanup
with ToolExecutionContext() as context:
    result = context.execute_tool(tool_id, parameters)
    # Context manager will automatically close resources even if an exception occurs
```

## Version Compatibility

Specify any version requirements or compatibility notes:

```javascript
// Requires Node.js 14+ for optional chaining and nullish coalescing
const metadata = response.metadata?.details ?? {};
```
