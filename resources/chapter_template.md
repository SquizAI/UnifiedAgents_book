# Summary

This chapter examined the Core Interaction Layer of unified agentic systems, the architectural component responsible for processing user inputs and coordinating system responses. We explored how this layer maintains contextual awareness through the session model, processes natural language through intent parsing mechanisms, and orchestrates tool execution through the dispatch system.

The technical implementation demonstrated how JSON schemas provide a structured interface between user intents and system actions, while the practical examples illustrated how these concepts apply to real-world development scenarios in code navigation, refactoring, and debugging tasks.

As we move forward to Chapter 4, we'll build upon this understanding to explore the Tool Management System, which handles the registration, validation, and execution of the various tools available to the agentic system.
