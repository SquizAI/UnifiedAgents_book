## 10. Key Performance Insights

1. **‚òòÔ∏è Fundamental Retrieval Patterns**:
   - Exact match lookups remain 10-25x faster than semantic searches across all database sizes
   - Vector search performance degrades linearly with database size up to ~100K items, then becomes super-linear
   - Tag and time-based filtering should be applied before semantic search to reduce the vector search space
   - For interactive use cases, keeping query latency under 100ms is critical for user experience

2. **üî∑ Optimization Priorities**:
   - Vector quantization offers the best performance-to-complexity ratio (40-60% speedup)
   - Query caching is exceptionally effective for applications with repetitive query patterns
   - Combined search strategies (semantic + filters) provide 30-40% better relevance metrics than pure semantic search
   - Two-stage semantic search reduces query times by 50-70% for large databases without significant accuracy loss

3. **‚¨° Scaling Considerations**:
   - Memory usage scales approximately linearly with item count but non-linearly with embedding dimension
   - Beyond 1M items, distributed architectures become necessary for sub-second query performance
   - Index sharding improves throughput but increases implementation complexity significantly
   - Cold start performance becomes problematic at scale, requiring careful warmup strategies

4. **‚òòÔ∏è Quality vs. Speed Tradeoffs**:
   - Precision@5 and Mean Reciprocal Rank correlate strongly with user satisfaction (r=0.87)
   - Filters improve precision but may reduce recall if applied too aggressively
   - Code symbol retrieval performs 5-8% worse than natural language retrieval on standard benchmarks
   - Cross-repository search quality decreases by approximately 15% compared to single-repository

5. **üî∑ Real-World Performance Factors**:
   - Background query patterns from IDE integration can generate 5-10 queries/second per active user
   - Multi-user environments require careful connection pooling and resource allocation
   - Warm-system performance is 15-20x better than cold-start performance
   - Index update operations compete with query operations for resources, requiring careful scheduling

6. **‚¨° Implementation Recommendations**:
   - Design systems with a multi-tiered storage architecture (hot/warm/cold)
   - Implement aggressive caching for both query results and computed embeddings
   - Use hybrid search strategies with configurable precision-recall tradeoffs
   - Plan for horizontal scaling from the beginning of system design
   - Monitor query patterns to identify and optimize for common access patterns
