   - Complex errors take 5-8x longer to detect than simple errors but have only 2-3x lower recovery success rates
   - Context enrichment improves error detection accuracy by 22-35% for complex errors

   - Optimal strategy selection improves recovery times by 45-60% over default strategies
   - Multi-strategy approaches (staged recovery) succeed 28% more often than single-strategy approaches
   - User interventions, while slower, have the highest ultimate success rate and provide valuable learning data

3. **System Resilience Factors**:
   - Graceful degradation capabilities preserve 65-95% of functionality during partial failures
   - Self-healing mechanisms reduce mean time to recovery by 62% compared to manual intervention
   - Prevention techniques collectively reduce error rates by 75-85% for common error categories

4. **Resource Considerations**:
   - Error handling pipelines consume 8-15% of system resources during normal operation
   - During recovery scenarios, resource usage can spike to 25-40% of system capacity
   - Predictive and preventive approaches have higher baseline costs but lower incident-driven spikes

5. **Continuous Improvement Metrics**:
   - Systems show 3-5% improvement in error recovery success rates per month of operation
   - Error classification accuracy improves 1.8% per month with feedback loops implemented
   - Recovery time decreases 4-7% per month as patterns are recognized and optimized
