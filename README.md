## Special Features

### Benchmark System

This book includes a comprehensive benchmark system with a three-tiered readability approach:

- ‚òòÔ∏è **Basic Level**: Essential concepts accessible to all readers, including decision-makers and non-technical stakeholders
- üî∑ **Intermediate Level**: Deeper technical details for practitioners implementing agentic systems
- ‚¨° **Advanced Level**: Complex implementation details for specialists and researchers

The [Benchmark Index](/resources/benchmarks/benchmark_index.md) provides a complete overview of all performance metrics and their relationships.

### Architecture Diagrams

Detailed architecture diagrams for all system components, including:
- Chapter 3 Core Interaction Layer diagram showing component data flow
- Chapter 8 Error Handling and Recovery flowchart with detailed process flows
- Performance-annotated visualizations connecting benchmarks to architecture

### Code Examples

All code examples follow our [Code Style Guide](/resources/code_style_guide.md) for consistency and readability.
